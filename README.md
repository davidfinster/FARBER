# FARBER


FARBER (Find and Replace Browser Extension Redux) is a fork of [Find and Replace Browser Extension](https://github.com/Dalimil/Find-and-Replace-Browser-Extension).

A signed Firefox plugin is [available here](https://github.com/dfinster/FARBER/releases/download/2.0.1/farber-2.0.1-fx.xpi).  


In version 1.3.19 the extension began collecting email addresses and some functions were placed behind a $3.99/month paywall. It also used analytics to track your behavior. Because version 1.3.17 is open source under Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, FARBER was born.

FARBER is maintained by David Finster. If it helps you, you are welcome to use it or fork my GitHub repository.

FARBER features:

* No paywall
* No Google Analytics tracking
* Improved compatibility with Zoho Books and Zoho Invoice
* Does not ask for donations
* Collects no information
* Open source under Mozilla Public License Version 2.0
